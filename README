Ternary for streaming based on Accept HTTP header.

  ( route, /^\/status/ )
    ( accept, "text/html" )
      ( PRE )
        ( player_status )
      ()
    ()
    (accept, "text/plain")
      (undefined, {headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain"}})
      ( player_status )
    ()
  ()


Notes / TODOs:

 * Does not account for q-factor (not sure that's possible in fab).
 * Need to implement RegExp matching to make more useful.
